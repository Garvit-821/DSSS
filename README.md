## Introduction
DNS Spoofing, also known as DNS cache poisoning, is a malicious attack where false DNS information is inserted into the cache of a resolver. DSSS is designed to detect and mitigate such attacks, ensuring the integrity and security of DNS queries.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors DNS queries and responses.
- **Detection Algorithms**: Identifies inconsistencies and potential spoofing attempts.
- **Alert System**: Sends alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Log Analysis**: Maintains detailed logs for post-incident analysis.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Implements automatic mitigation to block suspicious activity.
